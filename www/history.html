					<h3>Welcome to <span>HTML's HISTORY</span>!</h3>
					<br>
					<p>This is the history section. This section will briefly discuss the history of HTML including the man behind this language and how and where it started. You'll also see here the transition of versions of HTML.</p>

					<h3><span>It All Started Here.</span></h3>
					<br>
					<p>Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, and the inventor of the World Wide Web or most commonly known as the "Web". It all started at CERN, a large physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland where Tim was working that time. Tim came up with an idea that will let researchers around the world to put together information in an organize way. This, according to Tim, can be done using "links". This idea will also enable researchers to download files and save it to individual computers. To sum it up, all these things can be done using <span>hypertext</span> which is a way of linking documents together by clicking buttons on the screen. Tim already had develop this hypertext system in the year 1980 before he worked for CERN, it is called <span>Enquire</span>.</p>

					<h3><span>The Evolution</span></h3>
					<br>
					<p></p>
				</div>
				<div class="content" id = "1">
					<h3><span>HTML1.0</span></h3>
					<br>
					<p>The first version publicly available of HTML was published late 1991 and was a document called "HTML tags". It has 18 tags available for use and more than half of that 18 tags are still in use in the curent version of HTML (4.01)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content" id = "2">
					<h3><span>RFC 1866</span></h3>
					<br>
					<p>HTML2.0 or RFC 1866. It includes everything from the original version (1.0). It was the standard webdesign until 1997.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content" id = "3">
					<h3><span>HTML3.0</span></h3>
					<br>
					<p><span>Dave Raggett</span> introduced a new draft called HTML 3.0. This version was a failure because browsers took large amount of time implementing its features. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="content" id = "4">
					<h3><span>W3C and WILBUR</span></h3>
					<br>
					<p>W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) was founded in 1994 and was responsible for creating the HTML3.2, code-named "Wilbur". It became the official webdesign standard in 1997 and up to know, all browsers still support its features.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content" id = "5">
					<h3><span>Codename "COUGAR"</span></h3>
					<br>
					<p>Initially called "Cougar", HTML4.0 was recommended by W3C and later became the official standard of webdesign in Aprill 1998. It includes CSS for an easier way to modify and improve the looks of the HTML file.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content" id = "6">
					<h3><span>The Final Revision</span></h3>
					<br>
					<p>HTML4.01 was the final revision of HTML and the current version being use at the present time. XHTML was also introduce this time. It's a combination of XML and HTML.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content" id = "7">
					<h3><span>HTML5</span></h3>
					<br>
					<p>HTML5 surfaced at the time when XHTML2.0 was being proposed. Since XHTML2.0 is starting to look bad, a group of developers outside W3C started to build something on their own. Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group(WHATWG) was the name of the group responsible for HTML5. Although it's still under development, some features of HTML5 are already supported by some browsers.</p>
